# Unfolding-Subcortex
This repo. will experience the evolution and development of the "Unfolding the Subcortex" project. We will unfold the subcortical nuclei one by one with great attention and utmost precision using relevant methods.  The codes/workflows/scripts will be provided here. We will also provide all the cut-points, and any other supporting files necessary to reproduce the same results or improve the existing unfoldings or create new results.  Our work will help all us, the way we look at the sub-cortex and understand it. You should contribute.
